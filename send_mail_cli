To send mail using smtp

1. Connect to smtp server
    a. Use telnet (without tls)
    $ telnet smtp.office365.com 587
    
    b. Using encrypted connection
    $ openssl s_client -debug -starttls smtp -crlf -connect smtp.office365.com:587
    
2. Send hello to the smtp server
$ ehlo smtp.office365.com

3. Tell server for authentication
$ AUTH LOGIN
       <Authentication type>
       
4. Then the server returns a message like this "334 VXNlcm5hbWU6;". It is base64 encoded string asking for your username
    Provide the username in base64

5. Then the server returns another message "334 UGFzc3dvcmQ6;" which is the base64 encoded string asking for password
    Provide the password in base64

6. If the username and password is correct then it will return "250  Authentication successful" 

7. Then type the mail
mail from: mailfrom@anywhere.com

rcpt to: mailto@anywhere.com
